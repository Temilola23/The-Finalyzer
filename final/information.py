    "EPS represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It is a key indicator of a company's profitability. Higher EPS generally indicates a more profitable company.",
    "The P/E ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's current share price to its per-share earnings. It provides insight into how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio might indicate that a stock is overvalued, while a low P/E ratio could suggest it is undervalued.",
    "This is the ratio of a company's annual dividend compared to its share price. Dividend yield is important for investors looking for income from their investments. A higher yield can be attractive but might also indicate higher risk if the company's financial health is questionable.",
    "Market cap measures the total market value of a companyâ€™s outstanding shares of stock. It provides a broad perspective on the company's size and investment risk. Larger companies tend to be more stable, while smaller companies might offer higher growth potential but come with increased risk.",
    "This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. It is a measure of the company's financial leverage and risk. A high D/E ratio can indicate that a company is heavily reliant on debt to finance its growth, which might be risky if not managed properly."
